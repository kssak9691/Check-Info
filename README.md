Coming to work today at 9:00 AM, I started with checking my swipe login and logout of yesterday. Later, our mentor has come and started off with a new topic in our schedule. It  was particularly new and confusing. I felt bored and exhausted for a long period of time even while listening through the class. After lunch, I was a bit attentive and everything went past in a zoom through the evening. Finally, a review of our earlier performances ended our day at work.
